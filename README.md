# Labryinth Game Booth

This program is used with the Labryinth Game Booth, which is controlled by an accelerometer that a child with poor motor skills can use. The libraries from tockn, which is MPU6050_tockn, and Phillip van Allen, which is VarSpeedServo, are used to program the accelerometer and servos more easily. Depending on the current x and y angle of the accelerometer, the servos will change their angle in a slow and safe manner, allowing children with poor motor skills to enjoy this fun game!
